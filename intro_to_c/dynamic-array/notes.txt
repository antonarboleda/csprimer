12/6 
Today I spent 1 hour on the exercise. I watched the pointers videos and probably 
am going to need to watch it and practice pointers several more times. 

What I think I need to do is free the memory from the heap

Questions remaining 
- How do I delete an item?
- What I think I need to do is free the memory where that last element 
exicted and decrement the tail of the pointer.
